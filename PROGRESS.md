# Korus Project Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Korus is a self-hosted music streaming server built with Go, PostgreSQL, and modern web technologies. This document tracks the implementation progress based on the design specifications in DESIGN.md.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 1: Project Setup (High Priority)
- [x] Set up Go project structure with go.mod and basic directories
- [x] Create Docker configuration (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile)
- [x] Implement PostgreSQL database schema with migrations
- [x] Set up core Go modules (Gin, pgx, Bleve, fsnotify, JWT)
- [x] Implement database connection and configuration management
- [x] Create authentication system (JWT tokens, login/register endpoints)

### âœ… Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
- [x] Implement user management and authorization middleware
- [x] Create file system scanner for music library
- [x] Implement metadata extraction for audio files
- [x] Set up Bleve search index and integration
- [x] Implement PostgreSQL-based job queue system
- [x] Create file watching with fsnotify integration
- [x] Implement core API endpoints (songs, albums, artists)
- [x] Create audio streaming engine with range request support
- [x] Implement artwork serving and caching

### âœ… Phase 3: User Features (Low Priority)
- [x] Create playlist management system (Full CRUD operations implemented)
- [x] Implement user library features (likes, follows) (Complete service and handlers)
- [x] Add listening history and statistics (Full history tracking and analytics)
- [x] Implement search functionality (Bleve search fully implemented)
- [x] Add admin functions and system monitoring (Complete admin service)

### ðŸŽ¯ Potential Future Enhancements
The music server is feature-complete. Possible future enhancements:
1. Web UI client application
2. Mobile app support
3. Social features (sharing, collaborative playlists)
4. Advanced recommendation algorithms

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Web Framework**: Gin
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgx driver
- **Search**: Bleve (embedded full-text search)
- **File Watching**: fsnotify
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Job Queue**: PostgreSQL-based with LISTEN/NOTIFY

## Key Features to Implement
- RESTful API with authentication and authorization
- Music library scanning and metadata extraction
- Audio streaming with range request support
- Playlist management and user preferences
- Real-time file watching and automatic updates
- Full-text search capabilities
- User activity tracking and statistics

## Notes
- All tasks are tracked in the todo system
- Progress will be updated as each task is completed
- Design follows the specifications in DESIGN.md
- Focus on minimal dependencies and high performance
